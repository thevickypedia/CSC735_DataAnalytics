Data Analysis project using Scala

READ ME: Coffee Quality Analysis

The idea of this project is to analyze a dataset which has a list of scores given to a wide variety of coffee beans classified based on various categories. This includes a sum of 10 different subjective scoring fields and few other taste testing fields. The dataset has a list of attributes including Species, Country of Origin, Altitude, Region, Harvest Year, Processing Method etc. 

In this project, we used Python and Spark Dataframes to make an analysis and come up with the results. We worked on features that judge the quality of coffee and how external factor analysis, variety analysis, processing method analysis, country of origin analysis, producer analysis can affect the scores of coffee and the overall best and worst factors.
